\f0\fs32 \cf0 Instruction for the MPC decentralized algorithm:\
\
- there are several main algorithms, those which starts with MPC. Here a legend of the file name:\
TFC: optimizes on total fuel consumption\
Fmincon: uses fmincon\
Bayesopt: uses bayes opt\
NOSTOP: there is a loop that analyzes all the combination of fleet, from one vehicle up to 10.\
\
- Trend_TFC.m is used to make figures of TFC curve\
\
- plots.m is used to make figures of the velocities and densities from the folder DATA\
\
- folder DATA contains, divided by duplex and fmincon, the data coming from the tests}
